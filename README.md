# tableau_challeng


Data for this challenge was obtained from https://citibikenyc.com/system-data as instructed. 

I chose to use May 2024 data and June 2024 data. 

## Analysis 

1. NYC by Bike

    In this analysis I aimed to answer the question: What stations are perfomring well across the city? What are possible explanations? 

    The map shown on the first page indicates overall usage by station where each mark is a station and the color indicates high, medium or low usage. See legend within story for grouping parameters. 

    I paired this map with a visualization of rides by day, showing what days had the highest amount of riders and of those rides, how many were members and how many were casual users. 

    From this analysis I found: 

    The greatest concentration of "Medium" usage stations are within a mile radius of Union Square. Additionally more "Medium" and "High" usage stations can be found along the island perimeter and surrounding major attractions such as Central Park. 

    Across all stations, June saw more casual usage of Citi Bikes as compared to member usage. This may be attributed to a rise in summer tourism.

2. Rush Hour

    In this analysis I aimed to answer the question: What time of the day is bike usage the highest? What are possible explanantions? 

    This visual utilizes a map to show all station across the city with the size and color of the marker defined by total ride count.        The accompanying graph shows the ride count by hour. 

    From this analysis I found: 

    Bike usage, across all stations throughout May, peaks around 17:30 - 18:30 (5:30pm - 6:30pm). 

    This outcome is likely due to increased commuter usage after work, however, the morning commute does not show the same magnitude of       use.

3. Popularity

    In this analysis I aimed to answer the question: What stations are the most popular, and are the people using these stations primarily members or casual users? What are possible explanations?

    This visualization utilizes a table color coded by ride count for each station and is organized in descencding order. Paired with the table is a bar chart to show usage by member status. Additionally the bar chart shows what type of bike users are choosing. 

    From this analysis I found: 

    May ride counts showed the Citi Bike Station at Univeristy Pl & E 14th St to be a hot spot for riders. This station is located within a densly populated zip code and centrally located, making it optimal for bike travel. The vast majority of riders are members of the Citi Bike Program with all riders, regardless of member status, preferring electric bikes to the classic bike. 

    Stations with a higher casual rider count than member count may point toward tourist hot spots (ex. 7 AVe & Central Park South).

4. Going the distance 

    In this analysis I aimed to answer the question: What stations are showing the highest average ride time? What are possible explanations? 

    This visualization uses a table that is color coded by average ride time and organized in descending order. This visual is paired with a map and bar graph. Selecting a station from the table pinpoints the station on the map to provide context to the station location. Additionally, there is a bar graph to describe what bike type users are choosing at any given station. 

    From this analysis I found: 

    While the Beverley Rd & E 49th St station does not top the list for the busiest stations, the riders who begin their journies here are using their bikes for a longer period of time on average. Avgerage ride time is shown in hours. 

    When examining the map, this location shows to be in a less centrally location position and therefor may require bikers to take longer rides to reach attractions. 

    Many of the station with lower average ride time also show a higher member usage which may point toward rides that are used for short commutes rather than leisurely rides.
